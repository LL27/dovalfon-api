          In 1983, Alfon began writing for "Pi Ha'aton," the student newspaper of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Less than a year later, he was invited by Tom Segev and Nahum Barnea to join a new journalistic venture, the political weekly "Koteret Rashit."

          Alfon joined Ha'aretz in 1989, where he wrote a weekly column, "Kivun Harouah", about the relations between culture and money. He was appointed editor of the cultural page in 1992, turning it to the daily section "Galleria". He launched several new journalistic formats for Haaretz along the years [9] among them "Captain Internet", a weekly column supposedly written by a fictive grandfather investigating the new medium (1994), "The Marker Magazine", a business monthly (2001) and the re-designed Haaretz Weekend Magazine, where he was editor from 1992 to 1998.

          Dov Alfon was chief editor of the Kinneret-Zmora-Bitan publishing house (2004–2008) and hosted "Nispah Tarbut", a weekly cultural show on Israel's Channel 2 television (2002–2007).

          He was appointed editor in chief of Haaretz on May 1, 2008, serving in this position until 2011.

          In 2008, he published a special issue of the newspaper where leading authors replaced the newspaper reporters for a day. The experiment drew extensive coverage worldwide.

          He is co-editor, with writer Etgar Keret, of a new international cultural venture aiming to mix literature and cinema in a new format.

          His debut thriller novel was published in English as A Long Night in Paris in 2019.
